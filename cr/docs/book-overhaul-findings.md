### Spec under-documents implicit numeric widening (`lyric-language-spec.md` §Type Casts, line ~1473)

The spec currently says:

> **Implicit numeric widening:** smaller integer types widen to larger ones without an `as`. Cross-sign integer assignment (`i32` ↔ `u8`) is also implicit today — a footgun the roadmap intends to address.

But the compiler **also** does implicit int→float widening (e.g., an `i32` argument is accepted where `f64` is expected, the compiler inserts the cast). Confirmed by orchestrator (Hewitt) during Ch 1 revision. The spec should add a line: "Integer types also widen to `f32`/`f64` without an `as`." Until the spec is updated, Ch 1 §1.2 documents this behavior anyway because it's load-bearing for natural-looking numeric code.
